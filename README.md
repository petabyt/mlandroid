# The Magic Lantern Android App  
Unofficial and unfinished Magic Lantern Android App.  
Right now it only has basic PTP functionality and a
glorious replica of the Magic Lantern menu.

# What does it do?
https://github.com/petabyt/mlandroid/blob/master/src/main/java/ptp/PtpSession.java#L53  
Take pictures, get picture thumbnails, image reading stuff, and `0x9052` executeEventproc.  

# Compiling
This uses the Debian AndroidTools rather than Android Studio.  
Check out my [android tools install instructions](https://gist.github.com/petabyt/c83094677995d90ee3757f8fb3d4c00a) if you want  
to build from source.
